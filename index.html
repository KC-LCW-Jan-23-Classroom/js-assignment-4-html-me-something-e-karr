            <h2>Lawrence City League</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I first started playing kickball in 2016 with the Gym Class Rejects. We play in the Larwrence, KS Parks and Rec kickball league. In city league, there is a spring, summer, and fall season. We play on Friday nights from April-October. My team often finishes each season at the top of the league. Some faces change of the years, but we always have fun!</p>
