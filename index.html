            <h2>Lawrence City League</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I first started playing kickball in 2016 with the Gym Class Rejects. We play in the Larwrence, KS Parks and Rec kickball league. In city league, there is a spring, summer, and fall season. We play on Friday nights from April-October. My team often finishes each season at the top of the league. Some faces change of the years, but we always have fun!</p>

            <h2>Kaw Valley Kickball League</h2>
            <p>The Kaw Valley Kickball League (KVKL), is a local non-profit kickball league. We raise money for local charities while also playing kickball every Sunday from mid-May through mid-August. KVKL has existed since 2002 and has raised almost $100K for local charities.</p>
            <p>I also joined the Kaw Valley Kickball League in the summer of 2016. My first team was the Granstand Glass Kickers. I played four seasons with this team. In our fourth season, we had a new sponsor and became the JSC Electrkick Eels. During these four seasons, we usually won only one game each season, but we still loved to play as a team!</p>

            <p>In 2020, I joined a different team, Kansas Tree Care. However, the 2020 season was cancelled due to COVID-19.</p>
            <p>The league came back strong in 2021 and I've been playing with Kansas Tree Care ever since. Kansas Tree Care has remained undefeated throughout the 2021 and 2022 seasons. In a league of 36 teams, we've taken home the championship trophy two seasons in a row! Fingers crossed we get a three-peat in 2023!</p>
